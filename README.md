Q: what is library?
A: A library is a collection of reusable code that provides a set of functionalities that can be used.
    . collection of reusable code
    . reduces need to writer 'repetitive/complex things from scratch '
    . You control how/when it's used. No/few boundaries
    . saves time and effort
    . improves code quality and maintainability
    . makes code more readable and easier to understand
    . allows for easier collaboration and sharing of code
    . can be used in multiple projects
    . can be updated and maintained independently of the main project
    . can be used to create new functionalities or features
    . can be used to improve performance or efficiency
    . can be used to add new functionality or features to an existing project
    . can be used to create a new project from scratch

Q: what is a framework?
A: A framework is a high-level structure that provides a set of pre-built components and tools to
    .It has a predetermined architecture - you follow a specified pattern of development
    . you work within the boundaries set by the framework
    . It has a set of pre-built components and tools that you can use to build your application
    . It provides a set of pre-defined rules and guidelines that you must follow
    . It has a set of pre-defined APIs and interfaces that you must use
    . It has a set of pre-defined templates and blueprints that you can use

Q: When you might not want a framework?
A: .small project
. simple application
. Network load concerns
. learning curve
. Maintenance concerns
. Incompatibility
. Performance concerns
. prototyping
. proof of concept
. learning a new technology
. when you want to have full control over the code
. when you want to be able to customize every aspect of the application

Q: Why React?
A: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used by many companies.
   .Highest demand for job
   .largest ecosystem
   .less 'magic'
   .composable/declarative
   .Active Development
    . It's fast and efficient
    . It's easy to learn and use
    . It's highly customizable
    . It's widely used and supported
    . It's well-documented and has a large community
    . It's great for building complex and dynamic user interfaces
    . It's great for building reusable UI components
    . It's great for building scalable and maintainable codebases
    . It's great for building high-performance applications
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle large amounts of data
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle complex business logic
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle real-time updates
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle multiple users and concurrent requests
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle different screen sizes and devices
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle different languages and cultures
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle different time zones and dates
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle different currencies and payment gateways
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle different security and authentication requirements
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle different analytics and tracking requirements
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle different A/B testing and experimentation requirements
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle different machine learning and AI requirements
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle different IoT and device requirements
    . It's great for building applications that need to handle different blockchain and cryptocurrency requirements

Q: Why react composable code?
A: Composable code is a key feature of React. It allows you to break down your code

Q: Why react declarative code?
A: Declarative code is a key feature of React. It allows you to describe what you.
    Declarative:
    what should be done? -> "just tell me what to do and i'll worry about how i get it done"

    imperative:
    How shoud be done? -> 'Describe to me every step on how to do something and i'll do it'

Q: What is JSX?
A: JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.


Q: Why jsx in react?
A: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file. Although there are other ways to write components, most React developers prefer the conciseness of JSX, and most codebases use it.

Q: Why babel js use?
A: Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.


Q: why class change in react to className?
A: Unlike regular HTML, in React, you need to use className instead of class to define a class name for an element. This is because class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. This code will render a div element with the class name of my-class and a p element inside it containing the text "Hello World".

Q: why component name with first letter capital?
A: In React, the convention is to use PascalCase for component names. React requires that the first letter of components be capitalized. JSX will use this capitalization to tell the difference between an HTML tag and a component instance. If the first letter of a name is capitalized, then JSX knows it's a component instance; if not, then it's an HTML element.
